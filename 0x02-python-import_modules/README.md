# 0x02-python-import_modules

Some tasks showing different ways python modules are created and used.

## 0-add.py

A program that imports the function ``` def add(a, b): ``` from the file ``` add_0.py ``` and prints the result of the addition ``` 1 + 2 = 3 ```.
The output of the program is in the form:
- ``` <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> ```.
- The code does not get executed when imported using ``` __import__ ```.
