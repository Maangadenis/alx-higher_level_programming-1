# *alx-higher_level_programming*

*INTRODUCTION*

Entering the exciting world of High Level Programming, where we experience strong
 abstraction hence shorter programs. What's even more exciting is the use of an
 interpretor.

 This repository contains programs written in Python, C and Shell.

*PROJECTS*
